This is a template for using Go (with go-chi and air), HTMX, and Tailwind with Bun being our package manager and builder.


Instructions:
1. Install bun - https://bun.sh/docs/installation
2. `go install` - only dependency so far is air, and that's only for dev anyways
3. Install postgresql (for local dev) - https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/
4. `sudo pg_ctlcluster 12 main start` - more info needed on what this command does
5. https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ - an interface for postgresql
